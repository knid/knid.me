Technology is improving so fast. Everyday we hear new apps/softwares. Specially on ai side. We use them all day and for everything. Do you want to listen music? Okay open spotify. Do you want watch videos? Open youtube. And worse, use Google for everything. You search anything what you think. 

And you are using almost all app free. Sometimes you are paying for disabling ads but it’s not matter. True cost of using these apps **your data**.  And all “eyes” watching your data. Of course not real eyes. They are collect and save your all data. 

They know about you too much. 

Please don’t say “I don’t care who collect and save my data. I don’t wrong anything”. It’s look like “I don’t care freedom of speech because i don’t have anything to say”. Bullshit, right?

But there is more. They are manipulating us. 
If you say “I am hungry” beside your phone, your instagram feed will show a lot of food videos. And you will be more hungry and you will want to eat them. So you will buy that food from outside or you will buy somethings to make yourself. 

In anyway you did what they want. You watched more videos, spent more time on app and buy some products. 

This is just one example. And i think it’s awful to realize that. 

So what can we do?

We can improve our knowledge, privacy and security. 
We have to know about technology if we don’t want to be a product of big companies. 
We have to spend time and effort. 
…

So it will be hard gain control of our digital life in our central. 
And i think its impossible to gain %100 of control. But we will do what we can. 

This serie will be about “How i am trying to gain control of my digital life?”.  
I will follow my path and privacy model.

And in this serie you will be familiar some concepts and terms. Like DNS, VPN, HTTPS, VM’s, tor, Open Source, self-hosting, encryption…

But don’t worry i will explain everything from zero. 

So let’s start.
