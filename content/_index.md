Physics student, software developer, open source lover, bug hunter and writer (trying to be). I developed mobile games with unity, mobile apps with dart/flutter, web and cli apps with python, APIs in Django/DRF.

Now i am trying to improve my self on math, physics and backend programming. Currently i'm using golang for backend apps.

I'm also interested in embedded and low-level programming.
