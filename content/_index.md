# $> whoami

Physics student and backend developer with a passion for building systems that work â€” and understanding why they do. I work primarily with Go (Golang) and Python, developing robust APIs, backend services, and tools. My stack often includes PostgreSQL, Docker, and frameworks like Django/DRF.

Previously, Iâ€™ve built mobile games with Unity, apps with Flutter/Dart, and various CLI and web applications. Iâ€™m also exploring embedded systems and low-level programming as hobbies.

Outside of code, Iâ€™m always learning â€” especially in math, physics, and systems architecture. I occasionally dive into bug hunting, contribute to open source, and write about what I learn (or try to).
